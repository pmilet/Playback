# Asp.Net Core Playback
An Asp.Net Core middleware library that simplifies the recording and playback of WebApi calls. Suitable for saving user interactions in production to be replayed in development.

###  How to record incoming Api requests 

Once your Asp.NetCore Api is configured for playback ( see sample in github repo ) you can start recording and replaying Api requests 

When the X-Playback-Mode request header is set to Record the request will be saved.

```javascript
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: text/plain' --header 'X-Playback-Mode: Record' 'http://apigatewaysample.azurewebsites.net/api/Hello/hello'
```

then a  x-playback-id response header should be received. 

```javascript
Response Headers
{
  "date": "Wed, 25 Oct 2017 21:05:46 GMT",
  "content-encoding": "gzip",
  "server": "Kestrel",
  "x-powered-by": "ASP.NET",
  "vary": "Accept-Encoding",
  "content-type": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
  "transfer-encoding": "chunked",
  "x-playback-id": "_ApiGateway+Sample_v1.0_Hello%252Fhello_GET_757602046"
}
```

When the X-Playback-Mode request header is set to Playback the request will be replayed; you should also set the x-playback-id request header.

```javascript
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: text/plain' --header 'X-Playback-Id: _ApiGateway+Sample_v1.0_Hello%252Fhello_GET_757602046' --header 'X-Playback-Mode: Playback' 'http://apigatewaysample.azurewebsites.net/api/Hello/bye'
```

Notice that the response is exactly the same has before.

When setting the x-playback-mode to None the request is not saved neither replayed. 

### How to record responses received from outgoing requests

For recording incoming responses you could use the PlaybackContext injected in your Api proxies.

this code excerpt show how you can save a response received from an outgoing api call

```cs
       var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(url);
       var result = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
       if (_playbackContext.IsRecord)
            {
                await _playbackContext.RecordResult<MyServiceResponse>(result);
            }
            else if ( _playbackContext.IsPlayback )
            {
                return await _playbackContext.PlaybackResult<MyServiceResponse>();
            }
     
```

### How to fake api responses 

For faking api call responses you could implement a class that inherits from IFakeFactory.

this code excerpt show how to use the FakeFactoryBase abstract class to implement your own factory

```cs
public class MyPlaybackFakeFactory : FakeFactoryBase
    {
        public override void GenerateFakeResponse(HttpContext context)
        {
            switch (context.Request.Path.Value.ToLower())
            {
                case "/api/hello":
                    if (context.Request.Method == "POST")
                        GenerateFakeResponse<HelloRequest, string>(context, HelloPost);
                    else if (context.Request.Method == "GET")
                        GenerateFakeResponse<string, string>(context, HelloGet);
                    break;
                default:
                    throw new NotImplementedException("fake method not found");
            }
        }
```
